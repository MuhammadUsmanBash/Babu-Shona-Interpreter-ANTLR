If generated folder is present in file then:
**initial Requirements:
__Python 3.x.x__ with path added into system veriables

Step 1)
run this command on cmd:

If the generated folder is not present in the compiler file but grammar.txt is present
**initial Requirements:
__Python 3.x.x__ with path added into system veriables
__JDK 23.x.x__ with path (to JDK bin folder) added into system veriables


Step 1)
run this command on cmd:
